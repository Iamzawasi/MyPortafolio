## Pair Programming day Google Office Zurich

16-Nov-2022, I visited Google office in Zurich the purpose of the visit was to do pair programming with one of the google engineers.
I was realy amazed and inspired, the google engineer instructed me to code **_Game of life_** in python,
but when i returned I wanted to implement the same concept in Javascript and I was able to do that

Speical thanks for **_Powercoders_** **_Valentin the google engineer_** and **_google itself_**
